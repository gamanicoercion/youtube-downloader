# yt-downloader
A simple program that searches through youtube and downloads your video.

To use this, you need to have [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) and [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) installed and in your PATH.
You also need to have the `youtube_search` pip module installed.

This program makes a folder, `yt-dlp-py`, including `mp4, webm, mp3`, in your current working directory.
